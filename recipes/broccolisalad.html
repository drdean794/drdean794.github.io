        <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>2 crowns broccoli</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tahini</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mayo</li>
            <li>2 tbspoons red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tbspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 tspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tbspoon water as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded carrots</li>
            <li>1/2 cup roasted sunflower seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 cup raisins</li>
            <li>1/4 cup feta cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Instructions:</strong></h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep broccoli. Remove stems and cut into small, bite sized florets. The stems can be grated and added to the salad if desired.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, make tahini sauce by whisking together tahini, mayonnaise, red wine vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper. Add 1-2 tablespoons water as needed to thin.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the broccoli, shredded carrot, roasted sunflower seeds, raisins and feta. Drizzle with the sauce, tossing to coat.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the fridge to chill for at least an hour before serving. Serve cold. Keeps well for 4-5 days.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Notes:</strong></h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Broccoli</strong>: You can parboil the broccoli if you prefer softer broccoli. To do this, heat a pot of water to boiling. Add the broccoli and boil for just one minute. Immediately drain in a colander. Once drained, transfer to a bowl on ice. This will stop the broccoli from cooking and cool it down quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Red wine vinegar</strong>: This can be replaced with white or apple cider vinegar as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Shredded carrots</strong>: I usually grate my own carrots using a box grater. Two whole carrots yields about one cup of grated/shredded carrot. Otherwise you can use pre-shredded carrots.</li>
        </ul>
