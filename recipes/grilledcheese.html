        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices 1/2”-thick Pullman or other white bread</li>
            <li>2 tbspoons mayo</li>
            <li>1 tbspoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 ounces thinly sliced American or cheddar cheese (about 4 slices)</li>
            <li>Freshly grounded black pepper</li>
            <li>Tomato soup (optional; for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Instructions:</strong></h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Place bread on a cutting board and spread mayonnaise over top side of each; this is key to a golden, delectable crunch.</li>
            <li>Heat a small skillet (nonstick, ideally) over medium.</li>
            <li>Slide in half of butter.</li>
            <li>When it melts, place 1 slice of bread, mayonnaise side down, in skillet; top with cheese; season with pepper.</li>
            <li>Top with second slice of bread, mayonnaise side up.</li>
            <li>When underside is golden brown, about 4 minutes, turn sandwich and add remaining butter to skillet.</li>
            <li>Press down on sandwich to encourage even browning and to help melt cheese—be gentle, don't smash it.</li>
            <li>Cook until second side is golden brown and cheese is melted. Eat immediately, preferably with soup.</li>
        </ol>
