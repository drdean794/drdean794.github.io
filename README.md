In working on this recipes project, I have learned the following skills:
- Creating a navigation menu on my homepage with links to other pages on my site
- Creating multiple pages on a site and coding each of those HTML pages individually
- Creating return to homepage (index.html) links on each separate HTML page
- Adding images on HTML pages using the src attribute on the "img" HTML element, as well as using the alt, width, height attributes on "img"
- Adding links using href attribute on the "a" HTML element
