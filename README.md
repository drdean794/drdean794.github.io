In working on this recipes project, I have learned the following skills:
- Creating a navigation menu on my homepage with links to other pages on my site
- Creating multiple pages on a site and coding each of those HTML pages individually
- Creating return to homepage (index.html) links on each separate HTML page
- Adding images on HTML pages using the src attribute on the "img" HTML element, as well as using the alt, width, height attributes on "img"
- Adding links using href attribute on the "a" HTML element
- Using GitHub and Git using CLI commands
- Initiating repository, using git status to confirm changes, adding files to the Git staging area, committing changes from the Git staging area, pushing git changes to the online repository.
- Learned basic CSS syntax, learned about selectors, including especially the universal selector, type selectors, and class selectors.
- Used CSS syntax externally via a stlyesheet to modify and style some of my recipes webpages.
- Learned different ways to add CSS to an HTML file using 1. external CSS, 2. internal CSS, and 3. inline CSS. 
- Learned how to benefit the most from using HTML elements like div element, especially with the class selector.
